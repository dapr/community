## Charter

Community managers are responsible for managing many aspects of the Dapr community. The role is to engage and promote the Dapr community and have someone that the community can reach out to for guidance or to raise a concern. This document outlines a list of duties that a community manager can perform.

### Duties

A community manager can perform the following duties:

* Manage the Discord community including organizing and monitoring the Discord channels, establishing community rules, and aiding on the overall health of the Discord community.

## Process to become a Community Manager

Self-nominate via a [new issue in the community repository](https://github.com/dapr/community/issues/new) stating why you want to be an community manager, or alternatively contact an STC member. A community manager needs approval from 3 or more STC members. 

Once a community manager is approved they are added to the [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md) file including a non-voting statement to indicate the community manager does not have voting rights as the regular maintainers do.

## Removal

The community manager role is removed in case of the following:
* Expiration of the 12 months term.
* STC votes with simple majority to remove Community Manager.
* The community manager can ask to have themselves removed from the role.
