## Community Manager Onboarding (for community managers)

This document contains information about the tools that are used by the Dapr community managers.

### 1Password

Dapr uses 1Password that contains credentials for the various accounts that are used by the Dapr team members.

The community manager will receive an email from on of the project maintainers with an invite to join the Dapr 1Password account.

### Dapr Community repo

For planning and managing community calls, the community manager adds issues and edit them in the [community repo](https://github.com/dapr/community)

Once new community calls have been planned, update the community repo [README.md](README.md) with the new dates.

### Discord

The Dapr Discord server is used for community discussions and Q&A. The responsibility of the community manager is to manage and moderate the Discord server.

In case the community manager want to invite people to the Dapr Discord server, use this [invite link](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord).

The _Community Sync_ DM group is used by community managers to discuss moderation and management tasks, and to plan community calls.

### Twitter

The [Dapr Twitter](https://twitter.com/daprdev) account is used for:

- Asking the community for community call topics.
- Announcing community calls (one day before and one hour before the call).
- Announcing that the recording of the community call is available on YouTube.
- Announcing new Dapr releases.
- Announcing new Dapr blog posts or CNCF case studies.

The Dapr Twitter credentials can be found in the Dapr 1Password account.

### YouTube

The community call recordings are published to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@daprdev). Links are added to the video description, and video chapters are added for easy navigation.

### Google Drive

Google Drive is used for storing the Dapr community call slides.

- A new slide deck is created for each community call. Copy the most recent deck and rename it.
- Update the deck with the new date, host name and the agenda.
- Share the deck (with edit rights) with the speakers and in the _Community Sync_ Discord group.

The Dapr Google credentials can be found in the Dapr 1Password account.

### Zoom

Zoom is used for the Dapr community calls which are hosted by the community manager.

Join the call 15 minutes before the start of the call and have the other speakers join early as well so they can test their audio and screen sharing.

Zoom credentials can be found in the Dapr 1password account.
