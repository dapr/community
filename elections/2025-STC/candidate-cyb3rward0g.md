#### Contributions to Dapr

I have been involved with the Dapr community since 2024, focusing on extending Dapr Workflows to support AI-driven and agentic execution patterns. This work led to the creation of [Dapr Agents](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents), a project I designed and now maintain. It builds on Dapr’s workflow and durability features to provide a simple foundation for LLM- and agent-based orchestration.

[Dapr Agents](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents) has become one of the first community projects showing how Dapr’s components—state management, pub/sub, service invocation, bindings, workflows, and identity—fit naturally with modern agentic AI systems. It highlights how developers can build durable, fault-tolerant agent workflows using Dapr instead of building these capabilities from scratch.

Beyond the core implementation, I work with the community to explore new features, validate AI workflow patterns, and show how Dapr can support reliable AI automation and multi-agent systems. I continue to expand [Dapr Agents](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents) and document practical, real-world ways to build LLM pipelines, autonomous workflows, and multi-agent orchestration with Dapr.

#### Why I'm running

Many AI Agents frameworks today are rebuilding features that Dapr already provides, such as durability, retries, state, service communication, workflows as code and identity. I believe Dapr can serve as the common runtime that brings reliability and consistency to modern AI systems without forcing developers to reinvent this foundation.

If elected, I want to continue developing [Dapr Agents](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents) and create clear, code-first blueprints that show how to orchestrate LLMs, tools, and multi-agent systems using Dapr. My goal is to help the community adopt Dapr for AI workflows, share practical patterns, and demonstrate how Dapr can be a key building block for dependable agentic applications.
