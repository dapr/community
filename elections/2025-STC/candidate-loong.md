#### Contributions to Dapr

I've been involved with the Dapr project since 2023. Now I am currently serving as a member of the STC and as a maintainer of the Dapr runtime andcomponents-contrib repositories.

I introduces WASM to Dapr, adds [WASM HTTP middleware feature](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-middleware/middleware-wasm/), and works with contributors from Tetrate and other companies to optimize and enrich usage scenarios of WASM in Dapr.

With the popularity of AI, I introduce [Conversation API feature](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/conversation/conversation-overview/), now it has supported many powerful model providers.

As a maintainer, he actively conducts code reviews and conscientiously performs maintainer duties.

As a contributor in China, I take the initiative to communicate with Chinese users and developers to understand their opinions and expectations for Dapr, share these ideas with the community, and work with them to promote the establishment of the Dapr China Conference.

Also, I participate in various events and big conferences, such as KuebeCon, DaprCon, OpenInfra Days China, etc., to promote Dapr and recommend to attendees to try and use Dapr.

#### Why I'm running

I believe distributed runtime is an important part of AI infra with the rise of AI. I am working on improving Dapr's integration with AI and help oversee the technical direction of the project for the benefit of all users.
