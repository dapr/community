#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr
Most of my contributions to the Dapr project have been in the form of listening to the voices of adopters via GitHub and Discord, and turning that into action (creating GitHub Issues, socialising pain-points etc)

**Why you are running**

I will answer this in the context of my 2023 pledge...

> **Why you are running (in 2023...)**
> 
> I see a few challenges ahead...
>
>**Sustainability** - As Dapr increases its feature set and supports more component implementations, this creates a maintenance cost that must be paid. How do we ensure Dapr remains a sustainable OSS ecosystem?
>
>**Industry shifts** - The tech industry moves fast and we need to make sure that Dapr keeps up, without causing anxiety for existing adopters. What is the long-term roadmap for Dapr? Where must we experiment and place strategic bets? How do we deliver the roadmap in small increments, without bang-bang destabilising change?
>
>**Lastly and most importantly, Developer Experience and ease of adoption** - Dapr presents a subjective learning curve, particularly to those organisations who are new to k8s, and so if new adopters can't get to grips with Dapr swiftly, the engagement is lost. What should we do to make the experience better for folks?
>
>I'm not suggesting I have the answers at this point, but I do possess empathy for users, and I would like the opportunity to turn that empathy into action and be one of many voices at the table for representing the Dapr user community.

It goes without saying that over the last 2 years the entire world has seen an explosion in AI-based additions. Rightly so, Daprs new development energy and focus has pivoted to support this, with the introduction of the **Conversation** Building Block and **Dapr Agents**.

My view from 2023 is now more important than ever, we must **continue** to sustain what we _have_, as well as adopting the _new_. 

Looking back, my focus on Dapr has been much less on the AI/Agentic side, and far more on helping the community suceeed with adoption around State Management & PubSub as the core capabilities that most folks resonate with. 

I've personally invested a lot of my own time in helping with the quality and stability of Dapr Workflows, however it's fair to say that the 1.15 release did not meet the quality bar that adopters demand, and the ball was dropped. 

I have been a consistent adopter-advocate for Workflows, and I'm pretty confident that my efforts to signal boost the voices of the community have helped to ensure that maintainer effort was prioritised in the right places (not just Workflows!). As such, 1.16 was a great success, particularly for Workflows. More to be done for sure, and I will continue to be tenacious on the subject.

My primary motivation to remain on the STC will be to double-down on community representation of the founding, long-standing, Dapr Building Blocks, to ensure their continued stability and evolution. Dapr **must** continue to do the fundamentals well.
