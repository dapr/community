#### Contributions to Dapr

I've been involved in the Dapr project since 2021 right as it was entering CNCF incubations phase.  I am currently serving as a member of the STC and as a maintainer of Dapr Quickstarts.  

This year I am the STO for Dapr in Microsoft and Azure, maintaining improvement and support to Dapr in our Azure Container Apps and Azure Kubernetes services.  I engage deeply with large customers using Dapr and provide technical stewarhip.  I am an avid speaker and present at industry conferences such as Techorama and NDC.  The most notable project contribution I sponsored is the addition and growth of Workflow building block, and related durable tasks from the product side.  My main advisory of late is around AI and Agents, as an SME for remote MCP and contributor to tech direction for agents and durable workflows, which I share as much as possible with Dapr project.  

I am also a maintainer for quickstarts, helping future maintainers and contributors though guidance and mentorship, and building on the base I helped set up.  

#### Why you are running

I believe Dapr solves major problems in the Cloud Native & distributed app space such as automatically using best practices for resiliency, security, and observability.  I also 
believe that Dapr  levels the playing field enabling developers of all skill ranges to easily target their backends of choice, hosts of choice, and languages of choice without making unnecessary trade offs or lock ins and again while easily enabling best practices and avoiding traps.   

Some of the things I believe we need to continue investing in as a priority:
- Delivering the best Dapr Workflow API to meet cloud native developer needs
- Leaning harder into agentic development and devops scenarios
- Improving project efficiency and output using agentic devops processes (e.g. chores, testing, and even API content creation using agents)
- Integrating with other adjacent industry efforts in AI like Microsoft Agent Framework, Langgraph 
- Improving integration and fluency with Javacript/Typescript
