#### Contributions to Dapr
I've been an active contributor to the Dapr .NET SDK since early 2024. As of late last year, I became the 
Dapr .NET SDK maintainer and earlier this spring also became the Dapr JS SDK maintainer.

I'm the [top contributor](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk/graphs/contributors) of all time to the Dapr .NET SDK 
with over 75k lines of code over nearly 150 commits and have authored several of the Dapr packages:
- [Dapr.Cryptography](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapr.Cryptography)
- [Dapr.Jobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapr.Jobs)
- [Dapr.Messaging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapr.Messaging)
- [Dapr.AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapr.AI)
- [Dapr.AI.Microsoft.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapr.AI.Microsoft.Extensions) 

I've also contributed dozens of other bug fixes and features to the remaining core packages. I maintain Dapr's fork of 
[DurableTask](https://github.com/dapr/durabletask-dotnet) which underpins Dapr Workflows and as a maintainer of the 
[Aspire.Hosting.Dapr package](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/blob/a22d4f8fb5f0afba50db170f7f8c01f642e22c8e/CODEOWNERS#L68) 
in the Aspire community toolkit I've spent time developing solutions to improve the integration between Dapr and 
Aspire.

I have advocated for and submitted proposals for several key new features in Dapr including:
- Second-generation [speciality state stores](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7339)
including a [centralized cache](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/pull/71), a reimagined 
[key/value store](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7338) and a [binary store](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/pull/88).
- [Actor-based Dynamic PubSub Subscriptions](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/pull/78)
- [Workflow versioning](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/pull/94)

As an active member in the Dapr Discord channel, I go out of my way to comprehensively answer questions raised by the
community and to solicit feedback to help with feature prioritization.

#### Why I'm Running
Dapr dramatically simplifies the experience of building distributed applications and it's been exciting to design the
features that keep this project grounded, relevant and usable by the broader community. In today's world of 
ever-tightening time constraints, I feel that it's important that we focus our time on higher-impact features that
our broader community has indicated support. We have a broad foundation atop which we can build better cross-block 
integrations and a rich opportunity to leverage modern tooling to enhance the developer experience.

I'm running because I have a vision to make Dapr best-in-class for polyglot distributed systems development and would 
like to join like-minded individuals to shape and more effectively realize this dream.
