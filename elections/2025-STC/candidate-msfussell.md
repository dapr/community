#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr

I have been involved with the Dapr project since its first public release in 2019, to its continued success and growth within the CNCF today, including its gradution in 2024. My current role is a member of the Steering and Technical committee (STC), and maintainer of the docs and quickstarts repos, with a passion to create great developer documentation and experiences. My entire career has focused on developer technologies, immersed in the enterprise developer space, including building distributed systems platforms to run hyper-scale cloud services. 

Over the last couple of years I have: 
- Guided the Dapr project through to CNCF Gradation status in Oct 2024, ensuring all the due diligence questions were addressed, including end user interviews, processes and security reviews. This ensured that Dapr continues a strong presence in the CNCF including keynotes, video content and at CNCF events.
- Organize and run the STC meetings including setting agendas, writing up the notes and guiding the project direction. 
- Maintained and contributed to the Dapr docs, ensuring that the quality remains high, the consistency and accuracy of them is maintained. Also a contributor and maintainer to the Dapr quickstarts repo, I see these as essential for developers to learn the APIs.
- I review practically every docs and quickstart repo PR and hold all docs contributors to an high bar in their documentation writing.
- Provided input to the Dapr releases and continue to guide the release process.
- Continue to promote Dapr widely including presentations, videos, many recent podcasts this year, finding end users to write CNCF case studies, engaging with the Dapr Discord community and making community voices heard.
- Generally been involved in many aspects of the project, commenting on hundreds of issues and proposals.

#### Why you are running

Having been with the project since its inception, my passion it to keep the project on a clear and focused path and to build a strong and vibrant community. The Dapr project is now the center of the rise of AI agentic applications with Dapr Agents and having built a strong foundation of messaging, identity and durable workflows over the last 6 years. Dapr workflows can be at the center of enabling resilience and identity on virtually any agentic framework and if this takes hold it has the chance to 10x the usage of the project with the expected agentic application growth over the next 2-3 years. This will need clear messaging in the Dapr documentation, on the website and in the ecosystem and I am excited by this incredible potential. Dapr was desinger for this AI Agentic era and I fully intend to represent the project in the best possible way.

Beside the AI Agentic strategic outlook, the project has huge growth potential on its already successful trajectory with the establish APIs. Dapr is frequently turning up on industry analysts radars, we can double the number of contributors in the next 2 years and many organizations are realizing that Dapr ideal aligns with platform engineering needs, including multi-cloud strategies. To achieve this I will work tirelessly to promote Dapr, work with all organizations to incorporate Dapr into their solutions and build a vocal, vibrant community.
