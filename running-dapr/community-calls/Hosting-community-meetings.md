## Community meetings
Every two weeks we host a community meeting to showcase new features, review upcoming milestones, and engage in a Q&A. For community calls, anyone from the Dapr community can participate, present a topic, or host.

#### To host a community meeting, 
1. **Nominate yourself as a host.** Community members (members of the Dapr GitHub org) can nominate themselves via an issue on the dapr/community repository to be a community call host. 
2. **Get approved to host by existing hosts.** Members become approved community call hosts when two or more existing community hosts approve their request, similar to how members and approvers get accepted today.

After you've been confirmed to host a community call, follow the next few steps for hosting the call. 

## How to run a community meeting
When running community meetings, each meeting follows a similar process. Hosting can be broken down into two stages: (1) pre-call agenda confirmation, and (2) day-of hosting. 

### Pre-call agenda confirmation 
First stage of running a community meeting is to finalize an agenda. For each community call, there should be a planning issue titled  _Community Call Agenda_  within the community repository. The issue should be dated and match the date of the meeting you intend to host - this will be where the agenda for the call is finalized. Collaborate with Dapr community members and existing community hosts to create an agenda, then confirm the agenda with hosts and maintainers to (@dapr/maintainers-community) to finalize. 

After the agenda is finalized, circulate the slide deck template to all speakers in the agenda. Have each speaker follow the template for their slides.

#### Agenda confirmation checklist
- [ ] **Create a community call agenda issue.** in the [Dapr Community Repository](https://github.com/dapr/community). Date the issue to match when you'll be hosting.
- [ ] **Collaborate with community for agenda topics.** For agenda ideas, try: - (1) checking for interesting Dapr issues in popular repositories (proposals, discussions)
- (2) present on a Dapr related topic and invite collaborators involved to speak
- (3) ask existing hosts for speaker ideas
- (4) request speaker topics on [Discord Community Call chat channel](https://discord.com/invite/ptHhX6jc34)
- (5) ask existing host to check the [Dapr community call presenter sign-up form](https://forms.gle/Aa9L8iK32J4MBkxj7).
- [ ] **Fit speakers to community call (45-50 minutes).** Make sure agenda accomidates each speaker's presentation timing and allot additional time for questions. If there isn't time for all speakers, either schedule overflow speakers for the next community call or shorten speaking times for each speaker.
- [ ] **Confirm and finalize agenda.** As host, confirm final agenda for community call. Get sign-off on the agenda from either past community hosts or the community maintainers (@dapr/maintainers-community)
- [ ] **Create community call slide deck (from template).** Find the slide deck template here, [community call slide deck template](community-call-slide-deck-template.md). Add the community call agenda from the issue into the _Agenda_ slide within the template. Then add slides for each topic - one intro slide for each speaker's agenda topic, one slide for the speakers content. Make sure each presenter completed their slide before community call. 
- [ ] Share slide deck with existing hosts. Make sure to share the slide deck link is shared with existing community hosts in the discord community call chat channel
- [ ] Share community call links with presenters. Make sure all presenters have the link for the call, understand when the community meeting begins and to join the community meeting early. 
- [ ] **Confirm call details with existing hosts.** Confirm that an existing host is available to start and own the Dapr Zoom account during the community meeting. 

### Hosting community call (day-of)
On the day of the community meeting call, join using the link found on the main community page, [community meeting zoom links](https://github.com/dapr/community#community-meetings). Make sure all speakers are able to join, and that the slide deck is ready to go.

#### Day-of hosting checklist
- [ ] **Join community meeting link.** Join the community call 15 minutes early to confirm final details. Existing host or community maintainers should have already started the official Dapr Zoom account for you to join the meeting. Existing host list and information can be found here, [existing community call hosts](existing-hosts.md). 
- [ ] **Confirm that slide deck is ready.** Check the slide deck for the community call to make sure it matches the agenda discussed on the _Community Call Agenda_ issue. Also check that each presenter followed the template.
- [ ] **Record the call.** Ask existing host to start recording the call. 
- [ ] **Begin the community call.** Introduce yourself to the community (i.e., name, community role), review the agenss for the call and then hand off to speakers.
