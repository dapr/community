## Community Manager Onboarding (for maintainers)

These are actions that need to be performed by a Dapr project maintainer to give access to a new community manager.

The following information is needed from the new community manager:

- Full name
- Company name
- Email address
- GitHub username
- Discord username

### Update the Dapr Maintainers & Community Managers doc

Add the community manager to the _Dapr Maintainers & Community Managers_ document on the Dapr Google Drive.

### Update the Maintainers.md

Add the community manager to the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.

The format should be:

```
<First name> <Last name> (<Company>) <GitHub username> (non voting)
```

### Update the CNCF project-maintainers.csv

In order to get access to the CNCF service desk, the community manager needs to be added to the [project-maintainers.csv](
https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv).

- Create a PR to add the community manager to the project-maintainers.csv file.

The format of the entry should be:

```
,,<Full name>,<Company>,<GitHub username>,
```

### 1Password

The community manager requires access to these logins in 1Password:

- Twitter
- Google
- Zoom (CNCF)

- Send an invite to the new Community Manager to join the Dapr 1Password account:
  - In the 1Password menu go to Invitations -> Invite by email.

### Dapr Community repo

The community manager needs to add issues and edit them in the [community repo](https://github.com/dapr/community) for planning and managing community calls.

- Add the community manager to the Dapr community repo as a collaborator.

### Discord

The community manager requires access to perform management and moderation tasks on the Dapr Discord server.

- [Invite](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord) the community manager to the Dapr Discord server.
- Add the community manager to the _Community Manager_ role on Discord:

  - In Discord go to Server Settings -> Roles -> Community Manager ->  Manage Members -> Add Member.

- Add the community manager to the _Community Sync_ DM group on Discord.
