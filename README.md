## Introduction
The Distributed Application Runtime, Dapr, is a portable, serverless, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, stateless and stateful microservices that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, independent, building blocks that enable you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.

Visit [dapr.io](https://dapr.io) for information about Dapr.

## Dapr authors
Dapr is an open source project with an active development community. The project was started at Microsoft.

## Communication
We want your contributions and suggestions! One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions, chat on IM or join the bi-weekly community calls.

### Questions and issues
Reach out with any questions you may have and we'll make sure to answer them as soon as possible and as a community member feel free to jump in and answer questions.

### Community meetings
Every two weeks we host a community meeting to showcase new features, review upcoming milestones, and engage in a Q&A. For community calls, anyone from the Dapr community can participate, present a topic, or host. All are welcome! To present a specific topic on the next Dapr community call start by filling out this short form, [Dapr community call presenter sign-up form](https://forms.gle/Aa9L8iK32J4MBkxj7).  

The next 3 upcoming community meetings are pinned as issues in this repository and can be used to enter in suggestions for the meeting. To speak about a dapr-related topic on a community call just your topic to the agenda issue marked for the date you would like to present on. Alternatively, you're also welcomed to use the the Discord Community Call Chat channel to talk about future agenda topics. The meeting agenda for each call is finalized by the community call host.

Community members (members of the Dapr GitHub org) can nominate themselves via an issue on the dapr/community repository to be a community call host. Members become approved community call hosts when two or more existing community hosts approve their request, similar to how members and approvers get accepted today.

To accomodate different timezones, we schedule community calls at different times zone. See below for the time of each call (note you can always catch up offline by watching the recordings on the Dapr YouTube channel)

<!--
!!!REMINDER!!!

When adding new scheduled meetings to this list:
* make sure to update the URL for each entry too. The `iso` param should be updated following the `YYYYMMDD` format.
* make sure the suffix is correct for the numeral: `st`, `nd`, `th` so it reads right like `22nd` and not `22th`

#### China Community Meetings

https://cn.dapr.io/meeting/

每两周我们也将举行一次 Dapr 中国社区会议，会议语言为中文，欢迎参加。请点击上面的链接进入 Dapr 中国社区网站获取会议的详细信息。

### Milestone sync meetings

Every week, we meet to plan and sync on the progress for the milestone's release. This meeting includes maintainers and active contributors and usually lasts for about 30-60 minutes. If you would like to **actively contribute** towards a milestone, you are welcome to join that meeting too.

<!--
We are using a different link from Community Call because the Community Call requires the host to admit each person. In the weekly syncs, we "never" login with the host account.

## How can I get involved?

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with "Good First Issue" or the "Help Wanted" labels:

- [Dapr runtime repo](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [Dapr CLI repo](https://github.com/dapr/cli/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/dapr/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- [Quickstarts repo](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using Dapr.

If you're a developer, read the [development guide](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/docs/development) for help on how to get started.
