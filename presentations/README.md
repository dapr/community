   - your (online) slide deck
   - an event page with session details
   - a blog post that shows you spoke about Dapr at an event.
3. **Ensure to sign-off your commit**, see [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/contributing-overview/#developer-certificate-of-origin-signing-your-work) in the Dapr docs.
